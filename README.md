# Light-it-Up
This project was my last school project together with 2 of my friends. This project was made to save energy consumption from electricity using in light bulbs.

# Quick Abstract About The Project
##### The Main Tools used in this project are: NodeMCU ESP-8266 Board, Breadboard, LDR Sensors, LEDs, and some jumpers and wires.
##Turn the lights on, turn them off and it seems that we live in a perfect world.  

Every day as the lighting system in Egypt runs, we lose a lot of energy as a result of running the system on a dispensable time, about 696.491 million EGP per year. Day after day, energy in Egypt becomes more precious, so any provision of consumption will be welcomed. Trying to solve this grand challenge and aiming to avoid any energy waste from lighting systems, we decided to design an intelligent solution that combine the sensing ability of sensors and the power of the actuators together via technical internet-based connection. For that matter we decided to make a system of two computing boards and to connect one of them to a sensor that senses the light intensity of the periphery. Concurrently, the second board receives light intensity data from the first one and decides intelligently when to turn on/off the light and when to make it semi-operated. To make the solution does its best, it was unanimous that our solution needs to be affordable on the national scale, read and deal with accurate data, and to be characterized by the instantaneous interconnection between its numerous components. After collecting a crowd of data and comparing the number of working hours between the two systems, we found that our solution works 58 minutes less than the current system, saving an annual 820 million pounds compared to 785.4 thousand pound which is the price of the materials and its installation if it is applied on the whole country. We designed that solution hoping that it will put a decisive end to this challenge.
